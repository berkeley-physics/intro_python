    "### Introduction\n",
    "#### Welcome to programming\n",
    "An integral part of the physicist's toolkit is the computer. A computer is a physical device designed in such a way that the physical states of the system, and the relationships between them, can be mapped to those of any other physical systems. Thus we can simulate physical systems by identifying them with that of a computer. This mapping is so powerful in fact that it is more effective to think of the computer as a mathematical system rather than a physical one. The mathematics of computers, called computer science, is a rich field which connects seamlessly with physics in areas like (quantum and classical) information theory and complexity theory. Many physicists subscribe to some kind of notion of digital philosophy, in which the primary entities of the universe, the physical things, are nothing more than information (\"it from bit/qubit\"). In this viewpoint, computer science and physics are literally identical. It is not surprising then, that people interested in physics are often also interested in mathematics and computer science. However here we use computers only as tools that enable greater physical insight and understanding, and so for us right now they are a means to an end rather than an end itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be learning programming for physics in a language called Python. As such we will only teach you what you're likely to need to know. Thus while we won't talk about Turing machines or complexity classes, we recommend that you take some CS classes or use some of the extensive resources available online to learn more about this rich and interesting field of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are mathematical systems which we can program. We can create mathematical objects, and define the rules that determine how they behave. Physical systems also follow rules. By encoding those rules into a program, we can use the physical system that is a computer to simulate a vast array of other physical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compute things exactly using abstract mathematical objects as we would on paper, this is called __symbolic__ computing. We'd recommend [Mathematica](https://software.berkeley.edu/mathematica) for symbolic computing, but Python also has [a package](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) for it. Symbolic computing basically does the math for you because some mathematicians have codified into a program the usual rules of manipulation of mathematical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you are welcome to use symbolic computation, this is not the kind of computing we shall be doing here. We shall be doing __numerical__ computing, in which we approximate numbers to representations on a computer. Since a digital computer only has a finite level of accuracy (discussed further below), this process is not exact and does contain error. Sometimes one must be careful that the errors do not propagate and that our answers are not affected by it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "Why use computers? Can't we use good old-fashioned pen and paper to get exact answers instead of numerical approximations? Here are some things that are easy numerically, but extremely tedious if not untractable analytically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- transcendental equations\n",
    "- high-dimensional statistics\n",
    "- solving differential equations (Navier-Stokes: is fluid dynamics solved?)\n",
    "- data analysis\n",
    "- series expansions\n",
    "- evaluating functions\n",
    "- integration\n",
    "- basic arithmetic (what's $67+313^{344}-13*12 \\mod 235$?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of introductory notebooks, we shall do all of the above using standard packages in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook is an introduction to programming in Python. Each section introduces you to programming concepts and/or shows you how to efficiently implement schemes in Python. If you are familiar with Python, you might want to skip this notebook and move on to the next one which introduces you to scientific computing in Python. If you are familiar with programming but not Python, we'd recommend that you go through the relevant parts of the notebook to get familiar with Python quirks and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python vs other languages\n",
    "The Physics department has decided to use Python since it is the most commonly used language for applications in physics. Python is a _high-level_ language, which means that Python itself is written in a _low-level language_ like C, which itself is written in the binary instruction language understood by the computer. Thus when you run a Python program, it is first compiled to a C program. This C program is then compiled to machine instructions, which are then executed. A higher-level language allows you to do more things without having to write as much code, and not worry about the details of how things work under the hood. A lower-level language will be more verbose, but it gives you the ability to choose exactly how things are implemented, and thus allows you to make your code run faster. Since we use Python, our code will typically be shorter but slower than the equivalent code in a lower-level language. \n",

    "### Types of things\n",
    "These are many different types of primitive objects in Python. As you saw above, the most commonly used built-in types are integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`). Other commonly used types are pieces of text, called strings (`str`), and binary true/false objects called [Booleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) (`bool`). Python has a built-in function called `type()` that tells you the type of a given object."

    "`int`s are exact and Python 3 automatically resizes the data allotted to each int so that it can store an arbitrarily large positive or negative integer. On the other hand, `float`s are __not exact__. Essentially floating-point numbers are binary fractions multiplied by a scale. Typically Python uses 64 bits for floats, which are represented as $n=\\text{(53-bit integer)}\\times 2^{\\text{(11-bit integer)}-52}$. Thus there are 53 bits of precision, meaning that the float $f$ represents all numbers in a range of $2^{-53}f$. When subtracting floats that are very close to each other (e.g. taking derivatives), error that was intially a factor of $10^{-16}$ might scale up dramatically. The largest and smallest numbers floats can store are $2^{-2^{10}-52}$ and $2^{2^{10}-1}$ (we lose 1 bit to the sign of each integer). Trying to store smaller or larger numbers results in underflow or overflow respectively (but sometimes you can work in log space). Ultimately, since they are represented using 64 bits, there are only $2^{64}$ floats. This kind of thing is unavoidable when using a discrete system like a digital computer to model or represent a continuous system like the number line. Since these representational errors can compound, comparing floats is a bit tricky. For more information, read the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)."

    "_Packages_ are libraries of code made public for people to use, so that people don't have to solve problems that have been solved before or write code that someone else has already written.

You can also download packages from the internet. It is common to use a _package manager_ like [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

    "Lists and dicts are examples of complex data types, which can hold multiple pieces of information. These data types are useful generally, but different problems have different solutions. Lists are implemented as automatically-resizing arrays of contiguous memory. This means that (looking only at the [asysmptotic scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) of the cost of operations) acessing elements is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ (i.e. is constant with array size), and inserting or removing items changes with the index, from $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ at the end of the list to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ at the start. If you only need to insert and access things at the ends of a list, you might want to use one of the native Python `queue`s that are optimised for that. Dicts are implemented as hash tables, so accessing, inserting and removing is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, and so is checking for inclusion (which is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ for lists). Python also has native `set`s, which are essentially dicts with only keys.\n",

    "You can define data structures that are convenient for you by defining a `class`. Then you can create objects, which are _instances_ of the class. Using this paradigm is known as object-oriented programming. The class, as well as each object, may have associated variables and functions. These associated functions are called _methods_.

    "Again, it is easy to get stuck with infinite loops. To avoid this, remember to code a termination clause (i.e. a case where it returns something without calling itself), and to make progress towards termination at each function call. Recursion is usually aesthetically more pleasing than a loop, but is slightly slower due to the time taken to call each function. There are some problems for which recursion is better suited, particularly when the function calls itself multiple times per execution. Recursion is best suited for problems with self-similarity, which ties into concepts like fractals, scale invariance, and conformal symmetry in physics and mathematics. Such problems can typically be solved in $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$ time. For example, if we wanted to create a simple discrete version of the [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set), we could use the following recursive function:"

    "NumPy is written in C, which is a lower-level programming language than Python. This makes it much more efficient than Python. Lower-level languages give one more control while higher-level languages give convenience by hiding things in __black boxes__, i.e. by allowing you to use functions without knowing how they're implemented. If you're interested in making things run as efficiently as possible so that you can simulate larger systems more accurately, you might want to open these black boxes and maybe implement some things yourself. However the convenience of Python comes from the large number of packages that efficiently solve a lot of problems in the large variety of fields in which Python is widely used. Thus the Python paradigm is to not to reinvent the wheel, but we also recommend being aware of how things work under the hood so that you know which tool is best for a given problem. It's a fine line, and it's up to you to decide how you want to code. If you find yourself re-implementing things to make them faster, you might want to use a lower-level language like C. (You can also use your own implementations of things in other languages within Python for the best of both worlds.)\n",

As for `float`s, NumPy also uses 64 bits by default, but has more options for precision (you can use 16, 32, 64, or 128 bits for floats or integers)."

NumPy and SciPy have virtually every tool that one might need, and have optimised these to work well with NumPy arrays. In order to rewrite all your loops into operations involving NumPy arrays to make your code more consistent, you might need to multiply arrays of different sizes. NumPy automatically handles this to some degree with a process known as _broadcasting_, which repeats an array of size 1 in a given dimension to match another array.

Double-click to edit and press `shift`+`enter` to display these cells, just like code cells. You can change the type of a cell using the dropdown menu in the toolbar above. Markdown cells also support $\\LaTeX$, which is used for typesetting equations like $f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{-t^2}\\:dt$. If you're planning to do physics or mathematics, you'd probably want to learn it at some point. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an online LaTeX editor which also has tutorials (and Berkeley students also get free Pro accounts that make it easier to collaborate). Markdown has a variety of formatting options, and is a superset of HTML so supports all HTML formatting abilities. \n",
